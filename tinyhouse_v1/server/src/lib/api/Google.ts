//0 we'll construct an object we'll label `Google` that is to expose exactly what we'll need in our app.

//1 the generateAuthUrl()` function from the constructed `auth` object enables us to create
//the authentication URL that can navigate the user to Google's consent screen.

//2 the authurl field holds the authentication URL Google is to provide
//where users can sign-in with their Google account

//3  A single access token can grant varying degrees of access to multiple APIs. A parameter calledÂ `scope` controls this.
//In the `scope` option, we'll state that we're interested in the user's email and basic user info profile
//4 the`getToken()` function from auth accepts a code and creates an HTTP request to Google's servers to obtain the user's `access_token`
// 5 The `tokens` value we've destructed contains both the `access_token` as well as a value called a `refresh_token`. For our app, we are just using
//the tokens to obtain the user's information right away so we won't need to save them in our database. If we were to
//develop an app that uses these tokens for other APIs (e.g. using Gmail or Google Calendar API), we would most likely
//need them saved in our database for later use.
//6 We'll then run the `setCredentials()` function from the `auth` object and pass in `tokens` to configure the `auth` object.
//7 we can now use the configured `auth` object to make a request to Google's **People API** to get the user information we'll need
